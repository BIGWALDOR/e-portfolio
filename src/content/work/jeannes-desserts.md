# Jeannes Desserts

Building an e-commerce website is no easy feat. It requires careful planning, execution, and management. But when you're a home baker looking to sell your delicious creations online, it's a must-have tool for reaching a wider audience. That's where I come in. I recently built a full-stack e-commerce website for a home baker, and I'm excited to share the details with you.

To begin, we chose to use Next.js as the framework for the website. This allowed us to build a fully responsive website that would perform well on any device. We also decided to use a headless CMS in Sanity.io to manage the website's content. This gave the client the flexibility to easily update their website's content without needing to contact me for assistance.

For the checkout process, we chose to use Snipcart, a popular e-commerce platform that allows for easy integration into any website. This was ideal for us since we could customize the checkout process to meet the client's needs without having to build everything from scratch.

Finally, we integrated Stripe for payment processing. Stripe is one of the most reliable payment processing services available, and we felt confident that it would provide a smooth payment experience for our customers.

With the website fully built and ready to launch, we decided to host it on Vercel. This provided a fast and reliable hosting solution that could easily handle traffic spikes during busy periods.

Overall, building this e-commerce website was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The final product is a seamless online platform for the home baker to showcase and sell their delicious creations. The website is fully responsive, easy to navigate, and offers a seamless checkout process thanks to the integration of Snipcart and Stripe. I'm thrilled with the end result and look forward to seeing the home baker's success with their new online store.
