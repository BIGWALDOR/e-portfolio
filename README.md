# E-portfolio built with Astro

This project showcases my previous work through a personal E-portfolio built with Astro, a modern static site builder that leverages Markdown and the power of the web platform for flexible and performant web development.

## Features

- Responsive and accessible design optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- Dynamic content rendered from Markdown files
- Modular components using built-in Astro components
- Server-side rendering and static site generation for fast loading and SEO optimization
- Easy deployment and hosting with popular services like Vercel and Netlify
